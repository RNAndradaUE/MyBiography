            <h3>A Childhood Mom and Dad Experience</h3>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">
            <blockquote lang="en">
                <p>
                    I still remember the memorable childhood experience with my mom and dad. <sup>1</sup> 
                    I think it during my 6-10 years age of old, it was the best childhood of my time.<sup>2</sup> 
                    It started with dad who always brought me to school.<sup>3</sup> 
                    Every morning, dad always cooked the best breakfast in the whole world, better than Jollibee’s and McDonald’s.<sup>4</sup> 
                    It will always be the Maling, scrambled eggs, cheesy hot dogs, and many more.<sup>5</sup> 
                    It’s always the best breakfast ever.<sup>6</sup> 
                    Another one which made my morning memorable is that we are brothers of four, and then we went to the same school, 
                    which is University of the East.<sup>7</sup> The fun part is that we only had one bathroom in our house.<sup>8</sup> 
                    So, we needed to wake up around 4:30 AM to 5:30 AM in order to take a bath.<sup>9</sup> 
                    My eldest goes first then I go last.<sup>10</sup> 
                    I am grateful for my dad who always heated up the pot then poured it in a small shallow 
                    bowl then mixed some cold water, because I always hated cold water for shower.<sup>11</sup> 
                    Every morning routine is always like that.<sup>12</sup> 
                    However, whenever we woke up late, my dad and I always went to my favorite place, McDonald’s.<sup>13</sup> 
                    He always ordered the hotcake with sausage.<sup>14</sup> 
                    It was amazing; he always provided the “enough” to his children just to see our smiles.<sup>15</sup> 
                    Relating to eating hotcakes with sausages, my mom taught me how to eat it in a different way!<sup>16</sup> 
                    Rather than eating the hotcakes separately, instead you put the other hotcake to the bottom then 
                    the sausage in the middle with a topping of the last hotcake.<sup>17</sup> 
                    Then pour it all with honey syrup with butter; it tastes amazing, it became a 
                    burger pancake! All my sweet tooth and taste buds sparked like fireworks!<sup>18</sup> 
                    Mommy is very creative when it comes to cooking and making the food better!<sup>19</sup> 
                    Moreover, I remembered a time where my mom taught me an important lesson.<sup>20</sup> 
                    Is that to always stand firm, and committed to one thing I need to focus on.<sup>21</sup> 
                    Also, a lesson that I still apply on myself today.<sup>22</sup> 
                    She said to always give 30% love to the people who are close and relative to me.<sup>23</sup> 
                    Then 40% love to God, and lastly 10% love to my own self.<sup>24</sup> 
                    I asked my mom if it’s necessary to measure each love to one another, but 
                    she said it doesn’t matter what percentage for each love.<sup>25</sup> 
                    But to always give at least a percentage of love to yourself.<sup>26</sup> 
                    I wondered during that time and I didn’t understand it, but now I realize that
                    I needed to love myself in such tough situations.<sup>27</sup> She was right all along.<sup>28</sup> 
                    This is one of the most unforgettable experiences I had ever!<sup>29</sup>

            <h3>That One Different Girl – Unforgettable Teenage Memory</h3>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">
            <blockquote lang="en">
                <p>
                    I vaguely remember that one girl from Laoag where my parents and I moved in because of the missionary calling as Mission President and Wife for three years.<sup>1</sup> 
                    It was during 2015.<sup>2</sup> 
                    I was still 15 years old at that time, a young and innocent boy.<sup>3</sup> 
                    I was transferred to a Christian school named Divine Word College of Laoag.<sup>4</sup> 
                    The language was very foreign to me because their mother tongue is Ilocano.<sup>5</sup> 
                    Though I am an Ilocano also but I grew up in Manila, basically I speak pure Tagalog.<sup>6</sup> 
                    I can’t communicate nor hardly understand whatever they say to me.<sup>7</sup> 
                    It was a culture shock to me.<sup>8</sup> 
                    However, there were friends that helped me to understand their language.<sup>9</sup> 
                    Eventually, I learned to understand but was unable to speak their language.<sup>10</sup> 
                    Moreover, throughout my schooling in Laoag, I met a girl named Anndrae.<sup>11</sup> 
                    She’s a classmate of mine, and we have common interests.<sup>12</sup> 
                    One is that she came from Manila also, speaks Tagalog, and is a true friend.<sup>13</sup> 
                    She’s also my crush.<sup>14</sup> 
                    But this is not just a teenage romance story, but I learned the meaning of a true friend.<sup>15</sup> 
                    There’s this one lunchtime.<sup>16</sup> 
                    Students were not allowed to go to our classroom due to unknown reasons.<sup>17</sup> 
                    Then I snuck up to the room, then I thought no one was inside the classroom.<sup>18</sup> 
                    However, Anndrae was there reading her Game of Thrones book.<sup>19</sup> 
                    Moreover, we chatted a little then we heard a guard opening the doors of other classrooms.<sup>20</sup> 
                    Then, there’s this small balcony outside of the window, we needed to go over the window to be at that small balcony.<sup>21</sup> 
                    So, Anndrae and I went over the windows, then went to our own corners, shushing each other.<sup>22</sup> 
                    The guard went into our classroom, didn’t even notice us, then he left.<sup>23</sup> 
                    Anndrae and I were laughing that the both of us were outside on the balcony.<sup>24</sup> 
                    It was peaceful during that time; it was the best memorable teenage memory I’ve ever had.<sup>25</sup> 
                    Looking back at it today, she helped me realize a lot about life.<sup>26</sup> 
                    She helped me know that everyone has their own sufferings and you are not alone.<sup>27</sup> 
                    That’s the lesson she somehow taught me, and the way I perceive it.<sup>28</sup> 
                    I will never forget her.<sup>29</sup>

            <h3>Part-Time College Student? – Self Reliance</h3>
            <div style="text-align: justify;">
            <blockquote lang="en">
                <p>
                    College, college, college, it was the best first year of being a college student.<sup>1</sup> 
                    You know why?<sup>2</sup> 
                    I am one of those pandemic college students who went through online classes.<sup>3</sup> 
                    It was a great experience during those days!<sup>4</sup> 
                    However, I stopped going to school for 2 years and went to finish my missionary service instead.<sup>5</sup> 
                    Right after my missionary service, I went back to school again, which is my alma mater, University of the East.<sup>6</sup> 
                    Being in this school for 16 years now since 2008.<sup>7</sup> 
                    Moreover, college is fun if you are in a block section with the same set of friends in a semester.<sup>8</sup> 
                    However, for me, it isn’t like that.<sup>9</sup> 
                    I was in a free section.<sup>10</sup> 
                    So, I was sectioned with different college department students.<sup>11</sup> 
                    It was a little fun but it was like just going to work, sitting, listening to the professor then just leaving the classroom to go to the next class.<sup>12</sup> 
                    Though I wanted to make some friends, I am a very busy person.<sup>13</sup> 
                    As I lived alone here in Manila, my parents live in the province now, I have a side hustle which is my photography business.<sup>14</sup> 
                    Funny thing here is that instead of being a full-time student, I became a part-time student where I just go to school to complete requirements and get by.<sup>15</sup> 
                    Though there were challenging times that I experienced, balancing between school and freelance photography work, is that when there’s a hot date of bookings came by and then mixed with school requirements, it was hard.<sup>16</sup> 
                    However, I learned a lot from my 2 years of missionary service to become a self-reliant person.<sup>17</sup> 
                    Which is to use the best utilities and skills I have in every situation.<sup>18</sup> 
                    I sacrificed a lot of fun moments like hanging out with friends and other stuff that I missed.<sup>19</sup> 
                    However, I learned a lot doing this every day, working and studying, is that I need to do my priorities first.<sup>20</sup> 
                    I’ve seen the progress throughout my hard work, it really paid off, because my photography business is growing fast, clients are booking me consistently every month.<sup>21</sup> 
                    I am very grateful for what I have learned during my missionary service.<sup>22</sup> 
                    Now, I am a third-year college student, and I am almost finished with my degree.<sup>23</sup> 
                    I am excited to see more of these kinds of achievements in the future!<sup>24</sup>
